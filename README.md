# conways-game-of-life
i made conway's game of life in C++

took me about 3 and a half hours to get working and another 6h to optimize...

original implementation involved storing all cells(dead/alive) in a 2D array, which consumes a lot of memory and is rather inefficient

new implementation stores all live cells in a 1D array which is very quick and efficient
